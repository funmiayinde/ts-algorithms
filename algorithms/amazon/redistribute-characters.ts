/**
 * Given an array of strings words, return true if you can make all strings equal in words array
 * by performing any number of swap operations. Otherwise, return false.
 * In one "swap" operation, you can pick any two indices i and j, and move any characters from words[i] to any position of the words[j].
 * 
 * Examples
 * Example 1:
 * Input: words = ["aaa","bbb","ccc", "abc"]
 * Expected Output: true
 * Justification: Each string has 3 characters of a single type, 
 * and the last string has all 3 characters. We can redistribute the characters to form a string like "abc" making the distribution equal.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: words = ["ab","bc","cd","de","ea"]
 * Expected Output: false
 * Justification: The characters cannot be redistributed to make all strings equal 
 * because all characters appear only twice, making equal distribution impossible.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: words = ["zzx","xzz","zxz"]
 * Expected Output: true
 * Justification: We can redistribute characters to have each string contain one "x" and two "z"s, like "zzx", "xzz", "zxz", 
 * maintaining equal distribution.
